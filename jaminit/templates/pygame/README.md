# Pygame Starter Project
A minimal and well-structured base project for quickly starting new Pygame games.

## Run the Game
Make sure you have Python 3.10+ and Pygame installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start the game:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Project Structure
```yaml
src/                # Source code
├── main.py         # Entry point and game loop
├── settings.py     # Window size, FPS, colors, etc.
└── player.py       # Example player movement class
assets/
├── sprites/        # Image files and textures
├── sounds/         # Audio files
├── music/          # Music files 
└── fonts/          # Fonts used in-game
```

## Controls
**WASD** — Move player

**ESC / Close window** — Quit the game

## Customization
Edit settings.py to change resolution, title, or colors.  
Add more modules in src/ for enemies, levels, or UI.  

## Notes
This template is meant as a starting point for small game jam projects using Pygame.
Keep your code organized and build incrementally.
